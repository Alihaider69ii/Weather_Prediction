tock Market Prediction using LSTM

Developed an LSTM-based deep learning model to forecast next-day stock prices using Apple (AAPL) historical data (2015–2025) collected from Yahoo Finance.

Implemented multi-layer LSTM architecture with dropout layers to prevent overfitting, achieving strong predictive accuracy validated through MSE, MAE, and RMSE metrics.

Compared performance with ARIMA and Random Forest, demonstrating superior accuracy in capturing long-term dependencies and market trends.

Optimized data preprocessing with MinMaxScaler and 60-day input sequences, enabling robust modeling of temporal patterns in stock price movements.
